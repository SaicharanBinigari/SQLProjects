        COUNT(1) AS total_incidents,
        LAG(COUNT(1)) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(incident_date)) AS ld
    FROM
        fatalities_cleaned
    WHERE

    GROUP BY
        YEAR(incident_date)
)
SELECT

    ld,
    ROUND(100.0 * (total_incidents - ld) / ld)
FROM
    cte;

3. What is the number of fatalities that received a citation?

SELECT COUNT(id) AS Incidents_count_Citation
FROM fatalities_cleaned 
WHERE citation = "yes"

Executed Scenario:-
--------------------
SELECT citation, COUNT(id) AS Incidents_count_Citation
FROM fatalities_cleaned 
GROUP BY citation

4. What day of the week has the most fatalities and what is the overall percentage?

SELECT
    day_of_week,
    COUNT(id) AS Count_of_fatalities,
    round(COUNT(id) * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(id) FROM fatalities_cleaned),2) AS Overall_percentage
FROM
    fatalities_cleaned
GROUP BY
    day_of_week
ORDER BY
    Count_of_fatalities DESC, Overall_percentage DESC;


5. What is the number of fatalities involving welding?

SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(*) AS fatalities_involving_welding
FROM fatalities_cleaned 
WHERE lower(description) LIKE '%weld%'

6. Select the last 5 from the previous query

SELECT
    *
FROM
    fatalities_cleaned
WHERE
    description LIKE '%weld%'
ORDER BY
    incident_date DESC
LIMIT 5;


7.  Select the top 5 states with the most fatal incidents.

SELECT state, COUNT(id) AS Incidents_Count
FROM fatalities_cleaned 
GROUP BY state 
ORDER BY Incidents_Count DESC
LIMIT 5;

8. What are the top 5 states that had the most workplace fatalities from stabbings?

SELECT
    count(id) AS Total_count, state
FROM
    fatalities_cleaned
WHERE
    description LIKE '%stabbed%'
GROUP BY
    state
ORDER BY
    Total_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

9. What are the top 10 states that had the most workplace fatalities from shootings?

Actual one:-
---------
SELECT
    state,
    COUNT(*) AS fatalities_count
FROM
    fatalities_cleaned
WHERE
    description LIKE '%shooting%'
    AND description NOT LIKE '%troubleshooting%'
GROUP BY
    state
ORDER BY
    fatalities_count DESC
LIMIT 10;


Excetuable solution:-
-------------------
select state, count(id) as total from fatalities_cleaned 
where lower(description) like '%shot%' 
group by state 
order by total desc 
limit 10


10. What is the total number of shooting deaths per year?

select year(incident_date) as yr, count(1) as total from fatalities_cleaned
where lower(description) like '%shot%'
group by yr
order by yr desc;
