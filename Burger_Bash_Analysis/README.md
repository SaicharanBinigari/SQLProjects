INTRODUCTION:

I have a started a new business of selling burger because I read on my Instagram feed that „Burger Is the Future!
But I knew that burger alone was not going to help me get seed funding to expand my new Burger Empire - so I had one more genius idea to combine with it - I was 
going to Uberize it - and so Burger Runner was launched! I started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh burger from Burger Runner 
Headquarters and also maxed out my credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

Below are the Data tables that are used followed with the Insights that have been found out as part of this project.
